# Domineering Game with Monte Carlo Tree Search
---
## Project goals ## 
This project is an implementation of the Domineering game.<br />
The goal of the project is to:
  * The game works in console mode and allow a human player to challenge himself against a machine.
  * The machine is powered by a Monte Carlo Tree search algorithm which helps it to decide its moves.
  * In order to pick the best move, the algorithm calculates UCT scores.

## Setting up project ## 
 The program requires `Python 3.x` to be installed in your system.<br />

## Starting the game ## 
 To start the game, simply execute the following line of code:<br />
 `$> python Domineering.py`
